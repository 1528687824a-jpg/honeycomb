# Agent OpenClaw Orchestrator

A DBOS/Postgres-based multi-agent orchestration platform built around OpenClaw.

OpenClaw and ClawPanel are external products. This repository contains the
platform code, templates, docs, and local verification scripts that orchestrate
OpenClaw agents through a CLI adapter.

## Quickstart

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

In another terminal:

```powershell
$body = @{ prompt = 'demo multi-agent job'; requesterId = 'quickstart' } | ConvertTo-Json
$job = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/jobs' -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/jobs/$($job.jobId)"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/jobs/$($job.jobId)/messages"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/jobs/$($job.jobId)/timeline"
```

The default Docker Compose path is HTTP-only and mock-mode. Feishu and real
OpenClaw are optional adapters/modes configured after the core stack is running.

The desktop shell under `apps/desktop-app` is a thin React/Tauri client for the
same HTTP API. Its current MVP can create jobs, list recent jobs, inspect
timelines, and cancel non-terminal jobs.

## Local Checks

```powershell
npm run check
npm run check:no-secrets
npm run build
npm run smoke:docker-compose
npm run smoke:http-only
npm run smoke:feishu-webhook
npm run smoke:m2-recovery
npm run smoke:m3-config
npm run smoke:m3-real-planner
npm run smoke:m3-real-provider
npm run smoke:cancel-job
npm run smoke:tauri-shell
```

`smoke:m3-real-provider` is optional and requires local
`M3_PLANNER_BASE_URL`, `M3_PLANNER_MODEL`, and `M3_PLANNER_API_KEY`
configuration. It does not print secret values.

Optional real OpenClaw check, requiring a configured WSL OpenClaw runtime:

```powershell
npm run smoke:openclaw-real
```

Private/reference Feishu public ingress helpers:

```powershell
npm run prepare:public-ingress
npm run smoke:feishu-public
```

## Boundary Rule

Do not modify OpenClaw or ClawPanel source code as part of normal platform
development. Use `apps/dbos-worker/src/adapters/openclaw.ts` as the runtime
boundary, and keep prompt/config assets under
`platform-assets/openclaw-agent-templates/`.
