# Agent OpenClaw Orchestrator

A DBOS/Postgres-based multi-agent orchestration platform built around OpenClaw.

OpenClaw and ClawPanel are external products. This repository contains the
platform code, templates, docs, and local verification scripts that orchestrate
OpenClaw agents through a CLI adapter.

## Repository Layout

```text

packages/              Shared DB and type packages.
scripts/               Dev/start/smoke/maintenance scripts.
platform-assets/       Agent templates and clearly marked vendor workarounds.
docs/                  Project structure, boundaries, setup notes, history.

## Local Checks

```powershell
npm run check
npm run smoke:feishu-webhook
npm run smoke:m2-recovery
```

## Boundary Rule

Do not modify OpenClaw or ClawPanel source code as part of normal platform
development. Use `apps/dbos-worker/src/adapters/openclaw.ts` as the runtime
boundary, and keep prompt/config assets under
`platform-assets/openclaw-agent-templates/`.
